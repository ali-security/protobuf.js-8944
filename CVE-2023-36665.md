# CVE-2023-36665 in protobuf.js v7.2.4

As explained in this [comment](https://github.com/protobufjs/protobuf.js/issues/1918#issuecomment-1675042323), the changes required to remediate CVE-2023-36665 were not included in the `dist` version of the library.  
This omission leaves the distributed build potentially vulnerable.

To address this, we rebuilt the library locally using:
```bash
npm run make
```
